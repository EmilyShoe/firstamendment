                  <p>Watching the news, it would be easy to imagine that college campuses have become synonymous with
                  protest, violence, and the oppression of free speech. But is there evidence to show that support for
                  free speech is dwindling on America's college campuses?</p>

                      <p id="first-amendment">“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”</p>
                      <p>In the summer of 1787, politicians gathered in Philadelphia to draft a new Constitution. Part of this new
                      Constitution would be the Bill of Rights, a bill that would safeguard basic civil rights. This Bill
                      consisted of 10 rights and became the first ten amendments to the US Constitution. The Bill of Rights
                      was introduced to Congress in 1789 and adopted on December 15th, 1791.</p>
                      <p>The First Amendment protects the freedoms of speech, assembly, religion, petition, and the press.
                      This does not mean there are not reasonable restrictions. Speech provoking action that may directly harm
                      people, such as making specific threats or shouting fire in a theatre, is not protected. The press
                      cannot make false statements, known as libel. Freedom of Religion means that states cannot
                      have a state religion nor can they promote one religion above any others. Right to Assembly and
                      Petition can cover anything from signing a petition to filing a lawsuit against the government.</p>

              <div id="info">College campuses are good indicators of the state of free speech given their rich history
              of protest and progressive attitudes, from the Free Speech Movement at University of California,
              Berkeley, to now. Whilst some protests now seem to be focused on shutting down free speech instead
              of promoting it, as was seen at UC Berkeley in 2017, students are often the most open to exercising
              their First Amendment rights to protest.

              <h1>Who gets to speak?</h1>
                <p>You've probably heard about speakers being protested or shut down, especially on college
                campuses, for their controversial views. Over time, attitudes about allowing people with
                different opinions to speak has changed. <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/pages/show?page=gss%2Fabout">The General Social Survey</a> asks people
                    from different backgrounds and age ranges from around the United States questions about social issues. Some questions are
                    about attitudes towards free speech, and more specifically, whether people with different views should
                    be allowed to speak.</p>

                            This means that as people age they tend to allow different views to be shared less often.

                <h1>Are college administrators protecting free speech?</h1>
                <p><a href="https://www.thefire.org/spotlight/">The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a>
                    ranks colleges according to how the college's
                administrators allow free speech on campus. A college ranked <span class="red">red</span>  has one or more
                    policies that
                substantially and clearly restrict free speech. An example of this would be having a blanket ban on
                    'verbal abuse'. A college colored <span class="white">white</span> college has one or more policies that inhibit free speech, but
                on a much smaller scope, like banning posters that mention drink or drugs. <span class="blue">
                        Blue</span> colleges have a hands off approach to free speech. However, this does not mean
                    the college encourages free speech or that its students support free speech.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="btn overall">Overall,</span> only <span class="white">10%</span> of colleges have a blue ranking (with
                    58% ranking as white and 32% as red).</li>
                    <li>Only one <span class="btn ivy-league">Ivy League</span> college, the University of
                        Pennsylvania, was ranked <span class="blue">blue</span>. Harvard was ranked <span class="red">red</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="btn private">Private colleges</span> were <span class="white">twice</span> as likely to be ranked red than
                    <span class="btn public">public colleges</span> - 50.5% versus 24.7%. This may be because
                    private colleges have a right to restrict speech but since public colleges receive federal funding,
                        they are held to a higher standard when protecting the Constitution.</li>
